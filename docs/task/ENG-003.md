## Summary
Migrate project management workflow from single-file `task.md` tracking to PMA structure under `docs/task/` and `docs/plan/`, and update agent guidance to use `/pma`.

## Scope
- Initialize PMA core files and canonical formats.
- Migrate active task tracking into `docs/task/index.md` + detail files.
- Update `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` guidance from `/ptask` to `/pma`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- PMA directories and index/detail files exist and are populated.
- AGENTS instructions reference `/pma` three-phase workflow.
- Migration task status is synchronized across task trackers.

## Notes
- Legacy `task.md` is retained as historical archive and transition compatibility.
