## Summary
Ignore temporary artifacts under `docs/tmp/` so local scratch files are not tracked by Git.

## Scope
- Add ignore rule for `docs/tmp/` in repository `.gitignore`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `.gitignore` contains `docs/tmp/`.
- Files created under `docs/tmp/` are ignored by Git.

## Notes
- No runtime code changes.
