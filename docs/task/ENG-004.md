## Summary
Move the legacy archive file `task.md` from repository root into `docs/task.md` so project management files live under `docs/`.

## Scope
- Move root `task.md` to `docs/task.md`.
- Update references that explicitly point to root `task.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `/app/ai/bitk/task.md` no longer exists.
- `/app/ai/bitk/docs/task.md` exists with the original content.
- AGENTS/CLAUDE references are aligned with the new path.

## Notes
- This file remains a legacy archive; active task tracking stays in `docs/task/index.md` and task detail files.
