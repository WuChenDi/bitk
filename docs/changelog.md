Initialized PMA project-management files (`docs/task/*`, `docs/plan/*`, format docs, architecture/changelog) and migrated active tasks into PMA task index/detail tracking.

## 2026-02-28 05:47 [decision]
Switched project workflow guidance from `/ptask` to `/pma` in AGENTS/CLAUDE and marked `task.md` as legacy archive for transition compatibility.

## 2026-02-28 05:55 [progress]
Moved legacy archive file from repository root `task.md` to `docs/task.md` and updated active guidance references.

## 2026-02-28 06:03 [progress]
Added `docs/tmp/` to `.gitignore` to keep temporary documentation artifacts out of version control.
